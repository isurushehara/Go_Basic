Line 2: import ("fmt") lets us import files included in the fmt package.

Line 3: A blank line. Go ignores white space. Having white spaces in code makes it more readable.

Line 4: func main() {} is a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.

Line 5: fmt.Println() is a function made available from the fmt package. It is used to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World!".
